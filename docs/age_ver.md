# AgeVer

Eric uses *AgeVer* for versioning.

*AgeVer* assigns version numbers based on elapsed time since
a project's inception. The version number is formatted as three
distinct segments: the first represents the
number of years, the second represents the number of months,
and the third represents the number of days since the project's
creation. With *AgeVer*, you can quickly understand the maturity and
history of a project.
